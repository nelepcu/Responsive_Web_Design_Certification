            <article>
                <p>In this article we cover the absolute basics of HTML. To get you started, this article defines elements, attributes, and all the other important terms you may have heard. It also explains where these fit into HTML. You will learn how HTML elements are structured, how a typical HTML page is structured, and other important basic language features. Along the way, there will be an opportunity to play with HTML too!</p>

            <article>
                <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language. It is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content to make it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing tags can make content into a hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize words, and so on.  For example, consider the following line of text:</p>
                 <code class="block-of-code">My cat is very grumpy</code>
                <p>If we wanted the text to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in a paragraph <code>&ltp&gt</code> element:</p>
                <code class="block-of-code">&ltp&gtMy cat is very grumpy&lt/p&gt</code>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong>Tags in HTML are not case-sensitive. This means they can be written in uppercase or lowercase. For example, a <code>&lttitle></code> tag could be written as<code> &lttitle>, &ltTITLE>, &ltTitle>, &ltTiTlE> </code>, etc., and it will work. However, it is best practice to write all tags in lowercase for consistency and readability.</p>

            <article>
                <p>Let's further explore our paragraph element from the previous section:</p>
                <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started/grumpy-cat-small.png" alt="&ltp&gtMy cat is very grumpy&lt/p&gt">
                <p>The anatomy of our element is:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>The opening tag:</strong> This consists of the name of the element (in this example, p for paragraph), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This opening tag marks where the element begins or starts to take effect. In this example, it precedes the start of the paragraph text.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>The content:</strong> This is the content of the element. In this example, it is the paragraph text.</li>
                        <li><strong>The closing tag:</strong> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This marks where the element ends. Failing to include a closing tag is a common beginner error that can produce peculiar results.</li>
                    </ul>
                    The element is the opening tag, followed by content, followed by the closing tag.

            <header>Block versus inline elements</header>
            <aricle>
                <p>There are two important categories of elements to know in HTML: block-level elements and inline elements.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Block-level elements form a visible block on a page. A block-level element appears on a new line following the content that precedes it. Any content that follows a block-level element also appears on a new line. Block-level elements are usually structural elements on the page. For example, a block-level element might represent headings, paragraphs, lists, navigation menus, or footers. A block-level element wouldn't be nested inside an inline element, but it might be nested inside another block-level element.</li>
                        <li>Inline elements are contained within block-level elements, and surround only small parts of the documentâ€™s content (not entire paragraphs or groupings of content). An inline element will not cause a new line to appear in the document. It is typically used with text, for example an &lta> element creates a hyperlink, and elements such as &ltem> or &ltstrong> create emphasis.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Consider the following example:</p> 
                <code>
                    &ltem>first&lt/em>&ltem>second&lt/em>&ltem>third&lt/em>
                <br>
                    &ltp>fourth&lt/p>&ltp>fifth&lt/p>&ltp>sixth&lt/p>
                </code>
                <p> <code>&ltem></code> is an inline element. As you see below, the first three elements sit on the same line, with no space in between. On the other hand, <code> &ltp></code> is a block-level element. Each p element appears on a new line, with space above and below. (The spacing is due to default CSS styling that the browser applies to paragraphs.)</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Attributes">
            <header>Attributes</header>
            <article>
                <p>Elements can also have attributes. Attributes look like this:</p>
                <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started/grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png" alt="&lt p class=&quot;editor-note&quot;&gt My cat is very grumpy &lt/p&gt">
                <p>Attributes contain extra information about the element that won't appear in the content. In this example, the <strong>class</strong> attribute is an identifying name used to target the element with style information.</p>
                <p>An attribute should have:
                    <ul>
                        <li>A space between it and the element name. (For an element with more than one attribute, the attributes should be separated by spaces too.)</li>
                        <li>The attribute name, followed by an equal sign.</li>
                        <li>An attribute value, wrapped with opening and closing quote marks.</li>
                    </ul>
                 </p>

                <p>You made it to the end of the article! We hope you enjoyed your tour of the basics of HTML.</p>
                <p>At this point, you should understand what HTML looks like, and how it works at a basic level. You should also be able to write a few elements and attributes. The subsequent articles of this module go further on some of the topics introduced here, as well as presenting other concepts of the language.</p>
                <p><strong>Note: </strong>As you start to learn more about HTML, consider learning the basics of Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS. CSS is the language used to style web pages. (for example, changing fonts or colors, or altering the page layout) HTML and CSS work well together, as you will soon discover.</p>
